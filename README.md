# USA Real Estate Data Analysis Project by Walter A. Vasquez

## About

I chose a recent real estate dataset from Kaggle for this project because it presents a diverse array of information, perfect for resolving complex questions. The initial step involved cleaning the data in Excel to ensure its accuracy and consistency. I then used MySQL for in-depth analysis to resolve the questions. Finally, I created visualizations from my findings using Tableau, making the results not only accessible but also engaging.

## Purpose of The Project:

This project aims to uncover market trends, identify investment opportunities, and evaluate property performance across different US cities and states. Insights gained from this analysis will support data-driven decision-making for real estate stakeholders, including agents, investors, and developers, ultimately enhancing their understanding of the housing market dynamics.


### Business Questions To Answer:

1.	Average price and count of houses by bedroom count
2.	Most and least expensive places to buy a house
3.	Average prices by house size ranges

## Approaches Used

### 1) Clean Data in Excel

Loading the Dataset:

Initially, the cleaning of the data was going to be performed using SQL, but the dataset had some values that didn't match. MySQL was not able to upload smoothly, so I then decided to check out the data in Excel.
